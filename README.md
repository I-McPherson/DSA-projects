My personal and school projects.
This repository is for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.

This is for a job portfolio once that time comes.

These programs are designed to be compiled with this line in GCC:

gcc -Wall -ansi -oprogramname.exe programname.c -lm

Then are to run with:

./programname.exe

on Linux.

Thanks for downloading!
